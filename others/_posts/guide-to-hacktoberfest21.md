Hi there!

If you’re reading this blog post, you’re probably going to participate in Hacktoberfest 2022 or are thinking of it. Without any more chit chat, let’s get you equipped with all you may need to know/do to get started! These aren't exhaustive but just some of the things that you may need to keep in mind :)

Before anything, it may get you up to speed to visit the official website for Hacktoberfest 2022 - specifically, the [FAQ section](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/faq) there. You will have answers for anything ranging from what is Open Source and Hacktoberfest and how you can participate to questions about submitted PRs(Pull Requests) and their eligibility for Hacktoberfest.

## Some important terms to know

1. Open Source Software(OSS) - software whose code that is accessible by everybody to change or add to (RedHat has an amazing [article](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/open-source/what-is-open-source) on it that you may want to check out)

2. Version control - a way of syncing multiple collaborators versions on a shared project

3. GitHub - service that hosts stores all of our source code within repositories or projects along with other functionalities

4. Git - software that provides version control, tracking and any functionality to make lives of developers better while working collaboratively

5. Feature branch - Normally we don't develop off of master, each project would have its own rules but if you see Feature Branch - this is a branch created off of master for the change you're making (can be a bug/functionality/feature change) and where you will be doing all of your code changes

6. Pull Request (PR) - Once you are satisfied with your feature branch, you'd go back to GitHub and `compare changes to create a Pull Request` where the files from `master` or `main` branch in the repo will be compared with your files and the changes will be highlighted for anybody to review and/or approve so that it can merged into `main` or `master`

## To keep in mind

- Make sure to create a GitHub account and sign up for Hacktoberfest22 in the website
- Also take a look at the [list of events](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/events) that folks are hosting for Hacktoberfest22 - there are many online events and workshops for Hacktoberfest generally so defintely check these out!
- May help to know a bit about Git CLI or GitHub PR process (else you can learn it on the go!)
- Good to think about what tech and language you're most comfortable developing in (in case you want to fix issues or work on features)
- Get familiar with the terminal and have a code editor/IDE of your preference.
- Join the Discord sever for Hacktoberfest!
- Have an open mind and an eagerness to learn and be proud of your work :)

## Things you may learn with your contributions to an open source project

1. How to fork a repo
2. Git workflow
   - Create branch
   - Make changes
   - Compare with main branch and open PR
3. How to submit a PR
4. How to communicate roadblocks/knowledge gaps to others
5. Collaborate with folks seasoned in software engineering
6. Best pratices with the technology you're working with
7. Learning to learn and also be comfortable with starting off with very less details
8. Knowing more about the open source community

## Some general repository rules you may find

1. Read the new contributor guidelines
2. Read the pre-requisites/machine setup within the project README
3. If you're stuck, best to ask :) If it's a small project you may be able to @ the person who created the issue/the maintainer. For larger projects, you may have a `reviewers` tag or some detailed guidelines about who to reach out to.
4. If an issue/bug/feature already has recent comments or has been claimed recently, best to move to another issue - there's a world full of other issues/features that needs your help :)
5. Always keep your local `main` or `master` branch in sync with the remote one.
6. Be kind and respectful to the maintainers of the repositories - they will have to approve/comb through and leave review comments on so many PRs, so as budding open source contributors (or veterans), it's our job to make sure we keep things clean and spread kindess to the maintainers and other contributors!
7. Also, make sure the repository you want to contribute has the topic `hacktoberfest` on its page.

## I'm a complete beginner, what can I work on?

First off, pat yourself on the back for wanting to contribute to open source and to give your time for this! You've taken the first step and are here now :) Now, let's talk options.

DISCLAIMER - some/all of the options mentioned below need to first be checked with the maintainer(s) of the repo and then done.

- Most mid-sized projects lack proper documentation/may have some stuff to be changed within the README and docs. Now's your time to shine, pick that work up and do it so that other developers thank you for it later on. Documentation is perhaps one of the most important tools to any developer out there, including yourself.
- Tests :) that's right. Check if the project has sufficient test coverage or may need some love with some tests and work on them.
- Code quality - check if you can write existing code cleaner and also be ready to show why your way of writing that code snippet is cleaner :)
- Start by working on bugs/issues that are open and may contain the label `good first issue` or `first timers only` or something like `issue size: small` showing an indication that it is a small issue.
- You got this, don't worry!

Hmm, what else?

What are we waiting for, let's get started! Happy Hacktoberfest and make sure to have a lot of fun while you're coding away!
